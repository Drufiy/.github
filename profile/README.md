## Repository Architecture

This organization profile is backed by a dedicated [`.github`](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#about-organization-profiles) repository. The most relevant directories are:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/README.md` | Documents the intent of the shared `.github` repository and its reusable assets. |
| `/profile/README.md` | Powers this public-facing profile page. |
| `/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` | (Optional) Stores shared issue templates that appear across organization projects. |
| `/workflows/` | (Optional) Contains reusable GitHub Actions workflows shared across repositories. |

When introducing new automation, templates, or documentation, add them to the appropriate directory so they propagate to every repository in the organization that depends on these shared resources.

## Get Involved
